Installation
 
Download the zip file  AReigSTensors.zip and extract it to a directory where you like to save. 
Make sure Matlab paths are added correctly. 
To run the code, you need to install the SDP solver 
  - sedumi http://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/  
and polynomial optimization package 
  - GloptiPoly 3  http://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/
